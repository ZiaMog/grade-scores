<h1>grade-scores</h1>

<ol>
<li>Takes as a parameter a string that represents a text file containing a list of names, and their scores. </li>
<li>Orders the names by their score. If scores are the same, order by their last name followed by first name. </li>
<li>Creates a new text file called <input-file-name>-graded.txt with the list of sorted score and names. </li>
</ol>

<p>
For example, if the input file contains: <br />
BUNDY, TERESSA, 88 <br />
SMITH, ALLAN, 70 <br />
KING, MADISON, 88 <br />
SMITH, FRANCIS, 85 <br />
</p>

<p>
Then the output file would be: <br />
BUNDY, TERESSA, 88 <br />
KING, MADISON, 88 <br />
SMITH, FRANCIS, 85 <br />
SMITH, ALLAN, 70 <br />
</p>

</p>

<ol>
<li> Run the project in DEBUG mode to see the result of using 'UnitTest++' </li>
<li> Run the project in RELEASE mode to see the result of application (no 'UnitTest++' deployment) </li>
